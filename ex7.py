# List Comprehensions
#
# Letâ€™s say I give you a list saved in a variable: a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100].
# Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.

import random

a = random.sample(range(1, 101), random.randint(1, 20))
print("List: ", a)
b = [even for even in a if even % 2 == 0]
print("List of evens: ", b)
